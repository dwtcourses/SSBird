## Overview

The most common way to manage master data is to create data in Excel or Spreadsheet, and reflect it to GitHub or database.  
Of these, SSBird minimizes the cost of managing master data by taking care of the process of creating data and pushing it to GitHub, except for parts that are dependent on each project's development environment, such as reflecting database.

It also has features for merging sheets and creating Pull Request in consideration of parallel work by multiple people and data checking in CI. 
As an operational flow, we assume that when a csv is pushed to GitHub, it is imported into the database on CI/CD.

### About `extension-config.json`

```jsonc
{
  // URLs that can be obtained after publishing a web application in apply.gs
  "applyUrl": "https://script.google.com/XXXXXXX/exec",

  // URL of the GitHub repository to push
  // Please give the user who issues the access token more than Write permission
  "repositoryUrl": "https://github.com/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX",

  // The path from this ID folder to Spreadsheet will be the path on GitHub
  // The ID of the folder is the URL in the state of opening the folder with a browser, and
  // https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/XXXXXXX
  // XXXXXXX part is applicable
  "rootFolderId": "XXXXXXX"

### How to reflect the sheet directly

1. Create the sheet and data that you want to reflect in Spreadsheet

4. press "Apply"
5. if "Success ðŸŽ‰" comes up, it's a success!

### How to merge and reflect sheets

2. Please write only the data you want to overwrite in the sheet you want to overwrite
3. Select the sheet you want to reflect in the "Target Sheet"
4. Select the sheet describing the data to be overwritten in "Merge Sheets" (multiple selections are possible, and the data will be overwritten in the order of selection)
5. press "Apply"
6. if "Success ðŸŽ‰" comes up, it's a success!

### How to reflect data from multiple Spreadsheets

1. Go to the Google Drive folder screen that contains Spreadsheet you want to reflect
2. In the 'Apply Spreadsheets' section, select Spreadsheet you want to reflect
3. As for "Target Sheet" and "Merge Sheets", it is the same as [How to merge and reflect sheets](#how-to-merge-and-reflect-sheets), and is applied to all selected Spreadsheets
4. press "Apply"
5. if "Success ðŸŽ‰" comes up, it's a success!

### How to create Pull Request

1. turn on the "Create Pull Request"
2. As for "Target Sheet" and "Merge Sheets", it is the same as [How to merge and reflect sheets](#how-to-merge-and-reflect-sheets)
3. press "Apply"
4. if "Success ðŸŽ‰" comes up, it's a success! (In Pull Request, "Target Sheet" is base branch, "Merge Sheets" is head)

## Rules for merging sheets and converting csv

### Basic rules

- If the Spreadsheet name is example, it will be example.csv on GitHub
- If the target sheet name is develop, the csv will be pushed to the develop branch
- Data columns should be written with no spaces on the left and top (A1,B1,C1...)
- Cells with blank A columns or 1 rows will be ignored in both merging sheets and converting csv, so please use this when making notes (if you're making notes in B3, leave A3 or B1 blank)

### Rules for merging sheets

- Cells in column A (A1,A2,A3...) is the same, it is assumed to be the same data and overwritten, if not, it is added to the bottom as new data
- If the data is overwritten, it is not a problem even if the order of the data columns other than column A is different between the target sheet and the sheet describing the data to be overwritten because the data is overwritten based on the data column
- If the sheet containing the data to be overwritten has a new data column that is not in the target sheet, new data column will be added

## Overview

The most common way to manage master data is to create data in Excel or Spreadsheet, and reflect it to GitHub or database.  
Of these, MasterBird minimizes the cost of managing master data by taking care of the process of creating data and pushing it to GitHub, except for parts that are dependent on each project's development environment, such as reflecting database.

<p align="center"><img width="500" src="https://github.com/yukiarrr/MasterBird/raw/master/docs/images/masterbird-role.jpg" alt="MasterBird role"></p>

It is also configured to minimize the cost of deploying this tool by using Spreadsheet and making it serverless.  
As an operational flow, we assume that when a csv is pushed to GitHub, it is imported into the database on CI/CD.

### About `extension-config.json`

```jsonc
{
  // URLs that can be obtained after publishing a web application in apply.gs
  "applyUrl": "https://script.google.com/XXXXXXX/exec",

  // URL of the GitHub repository to push
  // Please give the user who issues the access token more than Write permission
  "repositoryUrl": "https://github.com/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX",

  // The path from this ID folder to Spreadsheet will be the path on GitHub
  // The ID of the folder is the URL in the state of opening the folder with a browser, and
  // https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/XXXXXXX
  // XXXXXXX part is applicable
  "rootFolderId": "XXXXXXX"
}
```

4. press "Apply"
5. if "Success ðŸŽ‰" comes up, it's a success!

### Merge sheets and push it to GitHub

2. Please write only the data you want to overwrite in the sheet you want to overwrite
3. Select the sheet you want to reflect in the "Target Sheet"
4. Select the sheet describing the data to be overwritten in "Overlay Sheets" (multiple selections are possible, and the data will be overwritten in the order of selection)
5. press "Apply"
6. if "Success ðŸŽ‰" comes up, it's a success!

### Push multiple Spreadsheets to GitHub

1. Go to the Google Drive folder screen that contains the Spreadsheet you want to reflect.
2. In the 'Apply Spreadsheets' section, select the spreadsheet you want to reflect.
3. As for "Target Sheet" and "Overlay Sheets", it is the same as [Merge sheets and push it to GitHub](#merge-sheets-and-push-it-to-github), and is applied to all selected Spreadsheets.
4. press "Apply".
5. if "Success ðŸŽ‰" comes up, it's a success!

## Rules for merging sheets and converting csv

### Basic rules

- If the Spreadsheet name is example, it will be example.csv on GitHub
- If the target sheet name is develop, the csv will be pushed to the develop branch
- Data columns should be written with no spaces on the left and top (A1,B1,C1...)
- Cells with blank A columns or 1 rows will be ignored in both merging sheets and converting csv, so please use this when making notes (if you're making notes in B3, leave A3 or B1 blank)

### Rules for merging sheets

- Cells in column A (A1,A2,A3...) is the same, it is assumed to be the same data and overwritten, if not, it is added to the bottom as new data
- If the data is overwritten, it is not a problem even if the order of the data columns other than column A is different between the target sheet and the sheet describing the data to be overwritten because the data is overwritten based on the data column
- If the sheet containing the data to be overwritten has a new data column that is not in the target sheet, new data column will be added
